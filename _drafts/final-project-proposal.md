# Final Project Proposals: 5 minutes of slides, sketches...something to ILLUSTRATE what's in your head.

# Collect inspirations: Quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills.

In ? the various projects at [MIT Media Lab's Tangible Media Group](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/), there seemed to be a faint connection to [Triangles and Narratives](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/triangles-and-narratives/) (2000) (an extension of the [Triangles](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/triangles/) project (1998)), which "explores ways in which people can create/navigate through non-linear narrative spaces using Triangles."

Another Tangible Media Group project, [SandScape](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/sandscape/) (2002), proposes "a tangible interface for designing and understanding landscapes through a variety of computational simulations using sand."

Similar projects include [Magic Sand](https://github.com/thomwolf/Magic-Sand) and the [Augmented Reality Sandbox](https://arsandbox.ucdavis.edu/) from UC Davis from which it was inspired

# Collect source material: Drawings, Images, Videos, Sounds, Text



# Collect code: Your own sketches. Other people's sketches.

# Collect ideas for a title?

# Collect ideas for 1-sentence description?

# Context? Who's it for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?

* probing, groping, slipping

* how might one communicate choice, progression, and navigation, in non-linear text that has literary flow without resorting to the old tropes of explicit choices presented at the bottom of the page, maps of rooms in a house, or the Cardinal directions of the early text adventure games.

# Collect questions for your classmates. What are you unsure of? Conceptually and technically.

* I like the idea that it's confined, that the scope and scale of the thing is communicated by the interface in some physical always

* I like the idea that there's a shifting around, a reordering

* I like the idea that it references a puzzle toy and in that sense (presumably) invites exploration within the context of constraints

# Help

1. Is the proposal clear?

 * What is it?

 * Where will it live?

 * Who's it for?

 * What are people being asked to do?

 * What questions does it provoke?

2. How can you push it further?
