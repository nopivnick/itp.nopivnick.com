# summarize any insights you have in each week’s lab assignments



# document your production projects and technical research thoroughly

- statement of intention
- what it looks like
- what it does
- what the user or participant does in response
- when it’s interactive, mention and show what the user does
- give enough information that someone who’s never seen the project can  understand it.

- make sure any code you post is well-commented but don't overdo it, use GitHub for complete code
- include a system diagram to make clear what the major components of the system are and how they communicate
- make sure to cite sources from which you get your ideas, code, circuits, and construction techniques
  - if you only changed one part of an existing program, post only the part you changed, and link to the original
