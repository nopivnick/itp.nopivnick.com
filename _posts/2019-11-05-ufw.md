# Five hours worth of `ufw.log` entires

My host, undernets.me, has been up since Sunday, September 8th.

```
root@undernets:~# uptime
 17:35:47 up 57 days,  1:53,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
 ```

The oldest log entry I have is dated Sep 29 06:40:15 so presumably either a. I didn't turn on `ufw` until three weeks after I first spun up the instance or b. `ufw` deletes rolled logs after a certain amount of time.

Most likely it's the latter. Logs that pile up with being deleted would eventually consume all available storage space. A friend and mentor taught me best practice is to mount `/var` in it's own partition for that very reason.

The Dev Ops engineer who taught me what little I know about this stuff was always adamant that a public-facing host be locked down to the greatest extent possible. If you don't need it, keep it closed. Since the exercise didn't require anything other than the ability to `ssh` remotely, the only port I opened up was 22.

```
root@undernets:~# ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp (OpenSSH)           ALLOW IN    Anywhere
22/tcp (OpenSSH (v6))      ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

Now that I think of it, I can't recall whether port 22 was open by default on the Digital Ocean image. Or for that matter, whether `ufw` was enabled by default.

# Data

There were roughly 125K `ufw.log` entries so I pulled approximately five hours worth worth of data from the end of the oldest log, 857 entries in all.

## Geolocation

For my IP geolocation data I used trial credits from IP2Location, in part because they provide a nifty [Google Sheets add-on](https://www.ip2location.com/free/plugins/others/sheet-add-on) for pulling results directly into the sheet and in part because I'm woefully inept when it comes to tapping into web APIs and as far as I can tell the the only way to utilize [Ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to reconcile geolocation a data set of more than one IP at a time.
