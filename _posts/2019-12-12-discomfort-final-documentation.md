# Project Description

Our final for Uses of Discomfort revolves around the materiality of glass.

The sound of glass shattering is both visceral and disturbing. It can evoke any number of unsettling associations: the tragic loss of a family heirloom; breaking one end of a bottle in an act of menace; a rock thrown through a storefront window in anger; the chilling sound of home invasion. It also signifies distress, as in the shout that comes from the kitchen: “Don’t come in! There’s broken glass!”

Glass is simultaneously sturdy and fragile. Glass has a long history as an information storage medium. Prior to the advent of cellulose nitrate film, photographic emulsions were captured on glass plate negatives. Modern laptop hard drive platters are made from glass. Silicon, one of the elemental building blocks of silicate glass, is the substrate on which the the ubiquitous microchip is fabricated.

# Experience

Ours was by design a small, intimate experience. Our participants were less an audience, more so guests.

Aaron and I made no broad attempt to recruit guests, posted no announcements to the student list. Instead, we each choose two individuals and asked them to join us. They were told nothing other than to meet us on the floor in the lounge at the designated time.

After collecting our guests, we walked as a group down the length of ITP’s exterior hall, only stopping at the furthest window sill counter, where we’d propped up six ⅛” thick 8.5”x11” glass plates. Each plate had been etched with a unique QR Code, three bearing Aaron’s image at their center, three bearing my image.

Our guests are asked to choose one plate each from the three. They wait while their host carries the first plate of glass chosen, ducks into a huddle room at the end of the hall, the interior of which is obscured from sight by a black curtain.

The host emerges, collects the first guest, asks them to please close their eyes and leads them by hand past the curtain into the room.

Eyes still closed, the quest is handed a pair of safety glasses and asked to put them on. Finally, their hands outstretched, they are handed a heavy irregularly shaped object.

The guest is then told they may open their eyes.

In their hands they are holding a jagged piece of concrete rubble, roughly the size of a melon. The rubble is tied to a green cord, the other end of which is fixed to a single point in the center of the ceiling.

In front of them, the glass pane they selected just moments ago hangs suspended a few feet off the ground by two thin pieces of string attached to the ceiling.

The guest is given no explicit instructions. A conversation may or may not ensue. Together, host and guest wait for the act to unfold.

# Reflection

- The experience could be improved if the sound of glass breaking behind the curtain was only within earshot of the next guest waiting to participate. if they are privy to the sound more than once, they've begun to understand it's an integral part of the experience rather than an accident or unintended consequence of some as of yet unknown event
- Participants, having just completed the experience, ought to leave through a separate exit without being given the opportunity to interact with the next guest
- It might be interesting if the etching of the glass were itself incorporated into the piece, an act of making shared by both the host and the guest might further complicate the guest's relationship to the object they are later asked to destroy
- The experience might be made more uncomfortable by leaving the guest alone in the room once they've been handed the rubble. Even better, constructing the installation in such a way that there is no possibility for the guest to opt out. Perhaps they are standing on a platform with a railing, their arms outstretching and holding the concrete rubble with no way to set it down.
