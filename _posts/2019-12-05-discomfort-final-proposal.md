Aaron and I are proposing to build an installation that uses glass as a catalyst for discomfort.

# Themes

Glass is a material the destruction of which is rich with symbolic meaning.

Kristallnacht is perhaps the most evocative example. The name and representation of this traumatic historical event is derived from an action, breaking glass. There is also presence in popular sayings such as "Those who live in a glass house should not throw stones at others", drawing a correlation between the material qualities of glass and the flaws of human nature.

A second departure point for the piece was memory. Some memories are sharp and piercing, like a shard of glass. Once broken, glass cannot be taken back to its original state, the same way that a memory cannot be erased. Once you know something impactful enough, it will not abandon your mind easily. A point of no return is as inherent to the material as it is to memory. Preciousness, shame and past are also deeply related. Shame and preciousness could be seen as deeply different from each other, but both can also be related to the quality of glass.

Finally, a digital layer of this elaboration on fragility and memory can be enacted in the form of encryption. This technique is commonly used to store something precious in a digital memory, visible but unintelligible. But encryption can be broken too, as processing power gets bigger, cracking techniques more refined and companies less trustful, some commonly used forms of encryption could be seen as crystals in a rope, waiting to be broken.

Glass provides the perfect medium with which to explore the relation between vulnerability, power and memory.

# Concept

One set of two participants are invited to choose a pane of glass each from a set of three. There are two sets of three, one for Aaron, one for myself.

One or the other of us takes the selected pane of glass from the first participant, enters the installation alone, and preps the pane of glass.

He then emerges, asks the first participant to join him behind the curtain, explains the premise of the piece (there are three panes, two of which are shameful one of which is precious and he has no way of knowing which is which).

Hands the stone to the participant and asks that the glass be shattered. The first participant is then escorted out from behind the curtain and the experience is repeated.

We’ve prototyped the interaction and etched the panes of glass. In keeping with Nick’s feedback, we incorporated a single piece of identifying information (our photos) into the design.

We still have a few logistics to work out: finalizing our safety protocol; how best to document; and how best to close the magic circle.

The plan is to run the piece Thursday evening when we’re both free and the floor is generally quiet.

Our biggest question is how best to close the magic circle once the glass has been shattered.
