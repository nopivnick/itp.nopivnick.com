I playtesting the [tangible interface for non-linear narrative](https://itp.nopivnick.com/physcomp/final-assignment-first-pass/) idea earlier this week and it was a miserable failure.

For one, the user's attention is split between the interface / surface / circuit and the screen. I suspect a tangible interface that can be operated without looking directly at the controls lends itself to a better reading experience.

I also suspect (have suspected for a while now) the project is a bit too high concept. It has about it a technical, clinical aesthetic. There's not much by way of elegance.

Furthermore, on the ICM side of things both Mimi and Shiffman had the same initial response when I described the project: that to accomplish any kind of fluid, meaningful, computationally driven transition between two nodes of text using natural language and/or semantic analysis is on a much higher order of complexity. Something on the scale of a thesis project, not a first semester final.

What to do.

I'm still drawn tangible interfaces for electronic text but perhaps it would probably be best to simplify and step back from non-linear narrative. At least for the time being.

At some point in the days following the playtesting debacle, desperate for a new direction, I had a fleeting notion of progressing through a text by pulling at a string of yarn. Then just yesterday my friend Michael shared with me a collection of twenty poems he'd written but never published. The collection is titled "Creaturely Life: twenty pre-elegies", written in stream of consciousness from the point of view of a woman keeping vigil over her dying husband. I find them terribly moving and immediately re-read them three or four times, I think perhaps in some irrational attempt to try and console the narrator.

Strangely enough, the last poem ends with a vision of the narrator knitting at the foot of her husband's deathbed.

So in giving it some thought I'm now envisioning a [yarn ball winder](https://www.knitpicks.com/accessories/Yarn_Ball_Winder__D82500.html) as a kind of metaphorical interface for reading this particular text.

From a purely practical standpoint [it's mechanical](https://pin.it/zdqm6yirlifez7) and so there are likely good opportunities to mount / incorporate sensors which I'll need to synchronize the flow of text on the screen.

I have a sense memory, from where and how far back I have no idea, of playing with a yarn ball winder as a child and finding the sensation strangely satisfying. Something about the wobble spinning on an irregular axis is evocative of an orrery and turning the crank somehow suggests the speeding up and slowing down of time.

The phrase 'spinning a yarn' comes to mind, though I believe the etymology there is to do with rope and sailors, not wool and knitters. And hyperbole, which has no place here.

There's also 'the whole ball of yarn' which according to [this post on Yahoo Answers](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060707144535AAoOAtA) (now a decade old) appears to have some interesting origins / connotations. The sexual connotation stood out if only because the person posting claims it has an Irish usage, if not origin, and there's a passage in the poems about Irish heritage.

The other meaning -- to complete something -- seems richer. At first I'd thought of pulling the yarn as a kind of unravelling but maybe it works this way as well. A kind of closure. Leaving one's affairs in order. An undoing, as distinct from a falling apart, which seems in keeping with the narrator's strength of character. It makes me think of that weird way in which people compose themselves at funerals and vigils. The ones who don't appear to be visibly distraught, at least.

Maybe I can buy some knit sweaters at a thrift shop and they can be unravelled as the reading unfolds, the yarn passing behind one side of the screen, emerging on the other, and spun onto the ball winder.

Or perhaps the yarn spins an umbrella swift (all new terminology to me) and makes it's way to the winder, the swift [spinning round](https://youtu.be/4CZBnsvDNBI?t=135), stripped of yarn, and slowing to a stop as the poem concludes.

Whirling Dervishes come to mind. And Moviolas.
