# Inspiration

I've always been mesmerized by metal casting in sand.

I'm not entirely sure where the fascination comes from but I've been known to binge on episodes of [How It's Made](https://www.sciencechannel.com/tv-shows/how-its-made/) and the images of molten metal pouring into forms made of sand and emerging as solid objects as the form crumbles away has always made me especially happy.

Some of it has to do with reusability. Each of the fundamental components of the process are reusable: the positive (the shape that's used to make the impression, years ago they were made from wood), the casting sand, the metal itself, reusable all.

Admittedly, sand casting is a 'creative interpretation' of the repeatability assignment for this week but if you think about it, from a certain perspective, it's sort of a universal jig.

# Conclusions

This is the first time I've cast in sand.

Clearly this is a complicated process with many variables and I was definitely winging it. The casts were far from perfect and clearly not uniformly consistent. I'd chock this up to lack of experience first and foremost but I suspect it has something to do with the fine detail of the object I was using as a positive. No doubt lost wax would give much better results.

I would have loved to have done this project in brass or bronze, but temperatures required to liquify those metals are significantly higher than pewter which is predominantly tin and I have no access to a foundry. Even brass or bronze alloys require 1500 degrees or so to flow, as opposed to the 500 degrees or so for pewter.
