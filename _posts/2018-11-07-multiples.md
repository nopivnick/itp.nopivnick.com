# Inspiration

I've always been mesmerized by metal casting in sand.

I'm not entirely sure where the fascination comes from but I've been known to binge on episodes of [How It's Made](https://www.sciencechannel.com/tv-shows/how-its-made/) and the images of molten metal pouring into forms made of sand and emerging as solid objects as the sand crumbles away has always made me especially happy.

Some of it has to do with reusability. Each of the fundamental components of the process are reusable: the positive (the shape that's used to make the impression, years ago they were made from wood), the casting sand, the metal itself, reusable all.

Admittedly, sand casting is a 'creative interpretation' of the repeatability assignment for this week but if you think about it, from a certain perspective, it's sort of a universal jig.

Nice square lines scored on a piece of square 3/4" ply, completely botched by a poorly aligned miter saw. It was stupid of me not to check the alignment and cost me a fair bit of sanding to get things sorted.

Pocket screw jig action. Just because. Love it.

Given the scale at which I'm working there was no reasonable way a driver could have seated properly in the screw heads had the pockets been facing inward so I made certain to think through the order of operations for a moment and be certain pockets facing out would work. Not an especially difficult mental calculation but this was my first go with pocket screws and I was still smarting from the miter saw fiasco.

I believe technically this block of wood, together with the Arduino, is called the pattern.

The wood block is deeper than the intended cast because you don't want to have to pour right up to the lip of the mould and risk molten metal spilling over. With casts made from two or more sides this function is provided in part by the gate (also used to regulate the flow of molten metal).

I put a bevel on the block to make it easer to pull from the sand.

Talc powder is used as a release agent to keep the casting sand from sticking to the pattern.

The wood frame is referred to as a flask. After my first cast I started filling the flask using a thin piece of card stock torn from a mailer so I could distribute the sand with a little more control than was the case by hand.

At this point the sand has been packed -- or rammed -- to a height that covers the pattern.

Then the rest of the flask is filled, rammed, and scraped to create a flat surface.

While not exactly a pancake, this was my first bad impression. A lot of sand broke free from the mould when I removed the pattern.

A heavier dusting of talc produced better results.

Due to the No Open Flame policy at ITP, I had to find someplace to cast. I ended up in the back alley behind my apartment building to cast and making trips back to the apartment after each pour to re-pack the mould.

After the second pour I got some strange looks form the super while waiting for the elevator so I relocated to the privacy of my bathroom. The ready availability of the shower head above seemed like a reasonable mediating factor.

# Conclusions

This is my first time casting in sand.

Clearly this is a complicated process with many variables and I was definitely winging it. The casts were far from perfect and clearly not uniformly consistent. I'd chock this up to lack of experience first and foremost but I suspect it has something to do with the fine detail of the object I was using as a positive. No doubt lost wax would give much better results.

I would have loved to have done this project in brass or bronze, but temperatures required to liquify those metals are significantly higher than pewter which is predominantly tin and I have no access to a foundry. Even brass or bronze alloys require 1500 degrees or so to flow, as opposed to the 500 degrees or so for pewter.
