# Inspiration

Chocolate.

I mentioned a lifelong preoccupation with repurposing interesting packaging in an [earlier post](https://itp.nopivnick.com/fab/flash-of-light/) and this is a particularly elegant chocolate box, if I do say so.

I particularly like how the lip (overhang?) on the lid and bottom give the enclosure a vaguely book-like look.

# Conclusions

This week's assignment was deeply gratifying.

The build went relatively quickly which is I suppose a testament to the value of repurposing existing packaging in terms of saving both time and money.

From here on out it'll be hard not to look at any and everything as a potential enclosure.
