For the first day of Haptics I had the pleasure of working with [Antonio Guimaraes](https://wp.nyu.edu/antonioitp/).

Antonio generously offered to compile notes and [authored a blog post](https://wp.nyu.edu/antonioitp/2018/11/05/group-experiments-1-through-3/) on our behalf, so long as I shared photos and provided clear, detailed descriptions of their content.

But I would like, if I may, to add my own addendum to Antonio's post. If only just to say a few quick words about my experience working together.

Antonio, for those readers not part of the present ITP community, is blind. This was the first time I've collaborated to any significant degree with someone who did not have the use of sight.

There is of course the old cliche about 'seeing something anew through someone else's eyes' and I've certainly had that experience (often pleasurable, though sometimes painful, especially when it comes to confronting one's own behavior).

The way in which I've experienced seeing something anew most profoundly is after having worked on something alone, usually a piece of writing, showing it to someone else for the first time, and having them give you some piece of insight that -- as my mother would say -- takes your head to another place. (To be clear: 'another place' referring to an entirely new perspective, as opposed to an altered state of consciousness). For that matter, there's even a kind of 'seeing anew' that precedes any feedback whatsoever, but simply comes the moment you relinquish the work.

I'm not sure to what extent those last few thoughts are related to the experience working with Antonio -- they may in fact be -- but I will say it was without a doubt a collaboration unlike any I've had thus far while at ITP. Not so much a co-creative collaboration, as that was not really the point of the first three experiments, but something closer to the etymology of the word: a doing of work together, a co-laboring.

For what it's worth, working with Antonio was the most 'present' and 'in the moment' I've felt since starting the program at ITP. I'm fairly certain it brought both the electronics and the code, albeit fairly simple in this particular exercise, into sharper focus than at any other point during any other school assignment or activity thus far.

And for that, I'm grateful.
