_Note: this post is currently in progress (I'm writing it and pushing edits as you read this)._

For my observation I choose a wall-mounted digital photo booth designed and (presumably?) manufactured by a company called [Smilebooth](http://www.smilebooth.com/).

The photo booth is mounted in the lobby of [Spring Studios](https://www.springstudios.com/shoots/new-york/), a slick commercial photography and events venue located in New York City's stylish Tribeca neighborhood.

Upon further reflection, I understood the correlation between a self-serve photo booth and a venue that provides raw space for commercial photography shoots but at first glance it wasn't clear what purpose the object served. This, despite having used similar devices before.

The device is acutely unassuming. It's design aesthetic is minimalist and modern (to whatever extent I understand those things) -- bordering on industrial -- and because the context shares those same aesthetic principles the photo booth blends into it's surroundings seamlessly, as though by (no doubt mistaken) intention. In no way does it draw attention to itself nor is it's purpose apparent, which is a curious decision given it's entire reason for being depends upon engaging users.

As if to illustrate that point, I spent the better part of an hour standing behind and off to one side waiting for people to engage with the photo booth and during that time the device only drew the attention of three individuals (separate from the individuals I filmed below). It's worth mentioning while the device is located indoors in what might be considered a pseudo-public space, my observation took place during the Tribeca Television Festival, during which there was was a significant amount of foot traffic.

This is the user flow:

The user interacts with the photo booth via a touch screen and the interaction begins with a choice: Animated Gif or Photo Montage.

I'm fairly certain in all cases it was the screen, not the intent / purpose of the device, that first drew their attention. That was certainly my experience.

Patterns:

- without exception, users selected the Animated Gif option first. I'm not sure whether this is because gifs are the more attractive proposition or because as reader / writers in this part of the world we tend to make selections starting from the left and moving right.

- the part of the interaction that took the longest was undoubtedly negotiating the on-screen keyboard while entering one's email address.

- excluding interactions that were abandoned before they were completed (or never begun), the entire interaction consistently took about one minute, give or take 5 to 10 seconds.

Recurring fails:

- touch-selections failed to register at least once per engagement, often more than once, more often than not while attempting to make the same selection.

- 'photo montage' option took a single photo only, confusing users

- subjects were not framed properly, despite standing centered with respect to the camera lens (example below)

It's difficult to record the minute details of any given interaction, especially when it happens so quickly. I eventually succumbed to recording the interaction on video however because it was such a confined space, and because I was loath to be seen as intruding on someone's privacy, I felt compelled to first ask permission. A purist would no doubt say this effectively 'contaminated' the observation but in my own defense, I only individuals who were not aware of the photo booth's presence and therefore had no prior experience with the interaction.

## Subject 1

Post-interaction interview highlights:

- touch-selections repeated failed to register
- hesitated to provide their email address
- was reluctant to engage with the device while in public
- was surprised and put off by the strobe flash

## Subject 2

Post-interaction interview highlights:

- misunderstood the onscreen instructions "Look Here" to mean 'peer into this part of the device' rather than 'direct your gaze to this point'
- without pause, provided a 'junk email account' when asked for an email address
- initially mistook the device for a wall-mounted hand dryer like those you find in public restrooms

## Subject 3

Post-interaction interview highlights:

- noted that the onscreen instruction to "Go Crazy" came *after* the screen directed the user to "Look Here"

TODO:

- Consider how the readings from Norman and Crawford reflect on what you see.
