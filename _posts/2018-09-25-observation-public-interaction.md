This post is in progress.

For this week's observation I choose a wall-mounted digital photo booth designed and (presumably?) manufactured by a company called [Smilebooth](http://www.smilebooth.com/).

The photo booth is mounted in the lobby of [Spring Studios](https://www.springstudios.com/shoots/new-york/), a slick commercial photography and events venue located in New York City's stylish Tribeca neighborhood.

Upon further reflection, I understand the correlation between a self-serve photo booth and a venue that provides raw space for commercial photography shoots but at first glance it wasn't clear what purpose the object served. This, despite having used similar devices before.

The device is acutely unassuming. It's design aesthetic is minimalist and modern (to whatever extent I understand those things) -- bordering on industrial -- and because the context share those same aesthetic principles the photo booth blends into it's surroundings seamlessly, as though by design. In no way does it draw attention to itself, which is a curious decision given it's purpose is entirely dependent upon engaging people.

As if to illustrate that point, I spent the better part of an hour standing behind and off to one side waiting for people to engage with the photo booth and during that time the device only drew the attention of three separate individuals. It's worth mentioning while the device is located indoors in what might be considered a pseudo-public space, my observation took place during the Tribeca Television Festival, during which there was was a significant amount of foot traffic.

This is the user flow:

The user interacts with the photo booth via a touch screen and the interaction begins with a choice: Animated Gif or Photo Montage.

Without fail, users selected the Animated Gif option first. I'm not sure whether this is because as gifs are the more attractive proposition or because as reader / writers in this part of the world we tend to make selections starting from the left and moving right.

Touch-selections failed to register at least once per engagement, often more than once, more often than not while attempting to make the same selection.

I'm fairly certain in all cases it was the screen, not the intent / purpose of the device, that first drew their attention. That was certainly my experience. One individual I spoke to said they initially mistook the device for a wall-mounted hand dryer like those you find in public restrooms.

The part of the interaction that took the longest was undoubtedly negotiating the on-screen keyboard while entering one's email address.

Excluding interactions that were abandoned before they were completed (or never begun), the entire interaction consistently took about one minute, give or take 5 to 10 seconds.

Because this was such a fascinating exercise, I wanted to film the interaction but because it was such a small space, I felt compelled to first ask permission. I suppose this effectively 'contaminated' the observation but I will say -- in my own defense -- I made sure everyone I filmed had not yet used the device.

## Subject 1

- touch-selections repeated failed to register
- hesitated to provide their email address
- was reluctant to engage with the device while in public
- was surprised and put off by the strobe flash

## Subject 2

- misunderstood the onscreen instructions "Look Here" to mean 'closely examine this part of the device' rather than 'direct your gaze to this point'
- without pause, provided a 'junk email account' when asked for an email address
- didn't actually understand it's purpose

## Subject 3
