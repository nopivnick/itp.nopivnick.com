Mimi in particular continues to ask difficult questions about narrative structure and in what way it’s related to / navigable by tangible interface. Her questions are surgical in their precision.

Tom and Mimi both seemed to think a turntable as a shared interface is a promising route.

Tom even went so far as to suggest a turntable is elegant in its simplicity of interaction but I’m not sure it’s enough. I think each user may need their own secondary controller. A kind of ‘multiplier’ for lack of a better word, a way to modify speed and direction through the loop.

My mother cut film for many years. As a toddler I entertained myself stacking yellow 35mm film cores on the cutting room floor while she worked on a [Steenbeck](http://www.steenbeck.com/) flatbed.

Steenbecks have [a lovely interface](https://www.pinterest.com/nopivnick/itp_class_thesis/#interface_speed-direction-sentiment) for changing the speed and the direction film travels through the transport. I’ve seen it variously referred to as a ‘speed switcher’, a ‘paddle switch’, and a ‘hand controller’. This may be the route I end up taking.
