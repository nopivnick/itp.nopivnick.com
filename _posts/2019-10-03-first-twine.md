Reading the Shelley Jackson piece last week was so delightful because the piece is so very much an artifact of that particular time and in that sense so very familiar to me.

Something similar happens sometimes with people I don't even know, like punctuation followed by two spaces before the first letter of the following sentence. I feel a strange affinity with them because I know they are old enough to have used a typewriter and never shed that particular convention tied to that particular piece of technology.

I image it must be like that for coders, too. Language, syntax, and style. Greybeards and script kiddies.

Historically there was a tension between the old-school literary hyperptextualists and the interactive fiction crowd and it basically boils down to this: 'is it a game, or is it serious literature?'

[GET LAMP](https://youtu.be/LRhbcDzbGSU), the documentary about text-based adventure games, doesn't address hypertext literature per se but there's a brief moment during an interview with 'hypertext pioneer' Stuart Moulthrop, one of the early hypertext fiction authors (and a very sweet man), in which he refers obliquely to the tension I'm talking about:

Stewart offers a mea culpa of sorts in some footage that didn't make it into the final cut, I'll see if I can't find it.

This tension shows itself in a different context when Chris Klimas (creator of Twine, the most widely used tool among the interactive fiction crowd) offered a very civilized response to what is tantamount to a slight from Mark Bernstein (publisher of StorySpace, the first hypertext authoring tool for writers):

Below are two lexia I dug out from my college thesis. The writing is a little affected but it's telling.

> Hypertext lends itself to the gap I seek to represent as narrative. A form which is simultaneously visual and textual, Hypertext evokes allusions to space and motion. The perpetual comings and goings, places visited, re-visited, visited anew ...

> Equating this form with the 'choose your own adventure' books of our childhood, suggestions to the effect that it 'mimics the mind,' do the narrative application more harm than descriptive good. They are weak analogies, anxious rhetorical spoutings regarding a neophyte, as of yet un-articulated form. The suspect qualities of impetus and closure in narrative are sufficiently in question. 'Non-linearity' and 'disruptive narrative' are exhausted labels. My interest lies in a smaller (though equally immeasurable) unit of the electronic narrative: the in-between, the moving from one place to another... the narrative void. I seek to draw out the link, to incorporate and exploit it for the sake of the telling.

It's always disconcerting to be confronted with one's own bias.
