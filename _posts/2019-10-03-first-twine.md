Reading [My Body](http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/jackson__my_body_a_wunderkammer/index.html) by Shelley Jackson last week was delicious. It's such an artifact of [the era](https://www.wired.com/2013/04/hypertext/) in which and [the tool](https://www.eastgate.com/storyspace/) with which it was authored. So much of My Body was familiar to me even though I'd never read it.

Something similar happens sometimes with people I don't even know, like [two spaces following the end of a sentence](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/two-spaces-after-period/). I feel a strange affection for these strangers because I know they are old enough to have used a typewriter and carry with them a writing convention that's tied to a particular piece of technology.

I image it must be like that for coders, too. Language, syntax, and style. Greybeards and script kiddies.

Historically there was a tension between the old-school literary hyperptextualists and the  interactive fiction crowd. It basically boils down to: 'is it a game, or is it serious literature?'

[GET LAMP](https://youtu.be/LRhbcDzbGSU), the documentary about text-based adventure games, doesn't address hypertext literature per se but there's [a brief moment](https://youtu.be/LRhbcDzbGSU?t=1h17m29s) during an interview with 'hypertext pioneer' Stuart Moulthrop, one of the early hypertext fiction authors (and just to be clear, a very sweet man), in which he refers albeit obliquely to the tension I'm talking about.

Stewart offers a mea culpa of sorts in some footage that didn't make it into the final cut, I'll see if I can't find it.

This same tension shows itself in a different context when Chris Klimas (creator of [Twine](https://twinery.org), a widely used tool among the interactive fiction crowd) offered [a civilized response](http://chrisklimas.com/the-economy-of-twine/) to what is tantamount to [a slight](http://publishingperspectives.com/2014/02/exprima-talks-reading-hypertext-with-mark-berstein/) from Mark Bernstein (publisher of StorySpace, the first hypertext authoring tool for writers).

Below are two lexia I dug out from my college thesis. The writing is a little affected but it's telling.

> Hypertext lends itself to the gap I seek to represent as narrative. A form which is simultaneously visual and textual, Hypertext evokes allusions to space and motion. The perpetual comings and goings, places visited, re-visited, visited anew ...

> Equating this form with the 'choose your own adventure' books of our childhood, suggestions to the effect that it 'mimics the mind,' do the narrative application more harm than descriptive good. They are weak analogies, anxious rhetorical spoutings regarding a neophyte, as of yet un-articulated form. The suspect qualities of impetus and closure in narrative are sufficiently in question. 'Non-linearity' and 'disruptive narrative' are exhausted labels. My interest lies in a smaller (though equally immeasurable) unit of the electronic narrative: the in-between, the moving from one place to another... the narrative void. I seek to draw out the link, to incorporate and exploit it for the sake of the telling.

It's always disconcerting to be confronted with one's own bias.

TODO:

- explicit choices
- tactile interfaces vs point and click
- progress and pace
