I'm not sure if it's my favorite (I'd need to give that a good think) but the tool I discovered most recently with a direct impact on quality of work-life is the [EZ-RJPROâ„¢ HD Crimp Tool](https://www.platinumtools.com/products/crimpers/ez-rjpro-hd-crimp-tool-100054c/) from Platinum Tools.

Terminating twisted pair ethernet cable is tedious, mundane work. This particular crimper tool design is used in conjunction with [specialized cable connectors](https://www.platinumtools.com/products/connectors/ez-rj45-cat6-connectors-100010c/) that allow the eight insulated copper wires in Cat6 network cable to pass through the front of the connector before crimping.

Like most things specialized, tools and consumables with unique features tend to be more expensive but in this case, my god, the savings in time and sanity are worth the additional cost.
