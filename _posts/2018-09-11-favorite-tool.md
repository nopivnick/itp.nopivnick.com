I'm not sure if it's my favorite (I'd need to give that a good think) but the tool I discovered most recently with a direct impact on quality of work-life is the [EZ-RJPROâ„¢ HD Crimp Tool](https://www.platinumtools.com/products/crimpers/ez-rjpro-hd-crimp-tool-100054c/) from Platinum Tools.

Terminating twisted pair ethernet cable is a very particular, tediously mundane kind of work. The secret ingredient in this case are the [specialized cable connectors](https://www.platinumtools.com/products/connectors/ez-rj45-cat6-connectors-100010c/) that allow eight insulated copper wires to pass through the front of the connector before crimping.

Like most things specialized, tools and consumables with unique features tend to be more expensive but in this case, my god, the savings in time and sanity are worth the additional cost.
